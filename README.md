This project develops and evaluates machine learning models to predict patient outcomes in liver cirrhosis based on clinical data. Using the Cirrhosis dataset, we applied data preprocessing, feature selection, and scaling techniques, followed by training and hyperparameter tuning of multiple algorithms including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks. Model performance was assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC, along with statistical significance testing. The study identifies key clinical predictors such as bilirubin, ascites, and albumin, and discusses the limitations and future improvements for clinical decision support systems in liver disease management.
